                        <p class="fs-5  lh-base">For Jama, a modern fusion restaurant, I was tasked with creating a
                            visually striking branding package that included a hoarding board and a food and beverage
                            menu. The goal was to excite and intrigue the public about the restaurant’s launch while
                            delivering a branding direction that balanced class and casualness. This project is one of
                            my proudest accomplishments, seeing the designs come to life in real-world applications and
                            being appreciated by many.

                        <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The primary goals for this branding project were to build
                            public curiosity and anticipation for Jama’s launch and establish a cohesive brand identity
                            that reflected the restaurant’s fusion of refined and casual dining experiences. The
                            hoarding board served as an initial introduction to the brand, while the menu provided
                            customers with a glimpse into the restaurant’s elegant yet accessible culinary offerings.

                        <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-2">Design Process</h3>
                        <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">Understanding Jama’s vision was key to ensuring the
                            designs conveyed the right message to its audience. I began by researching the brand’s
                            identity and target audience, exploring how a fusion restaurant could present itself as both
                            sophisticated and welcoming.
                        </p>
                        <h5 class="fw-semibold mb-2 mt-3">Hoarding Board</h4>
                            <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The hoarding board was designed to be a striking
                                visual that captivated passersby and invited curiosity. To achieve this, I featured
                                bold, modern typography alongside enticing images of colorful, plated dishes, hinting at
                                the restaurant’s unique menu. The messaging used short and memorable taglines, such as
                                “honest, wholesome, delicious” to spark interest and anticipation.
                            </p>
                            <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The color palette was inspired by natural tones with
                                warm, earthy accents, creating a sophisticated yet friendly aesthetic. The board layout
                                prioritized visibility and legibility, ensuring its impact even from a distance. Its
                                clean, minimal design provided breathing room for the key message, making it an
                                effective promotional tool that resonated with the public.
                            </p>

                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The menu required careful attention to detail to
                                    reflect Jama’s branding direction while maintaining practicality and readability. I
                                    incorporated a modern serif typeface for headings and a complementary serif
                                    typeface for body text, creating a balance of elegance and clarity.
                                </p>

                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The layout was clean and well-structured, with
                                    thoughtful spacing between sections to enhance navigation. Visual accents, such as
                                    subtle textured backgrounds and fine graphic dots, were added to elevate the
                                    aesthetic without overwhelming the content.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The final menu felt both polished and
                                    approachable, making it a pleasure to read and interact with, adding to the diners’
                                    overall experience.
                                </p>

                                <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Challenges & Solutions</h3>
                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">Designing for a large-scale format like a
                                    hoarding board posed unique challenges, especially in terms of scaling and
                                    visibility. To address this, I used bold fonts, high-quality imagery, and an
                                    intentional use of whitespace to make the design visually striking and impactful.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">Balancing the dual aspects of Jama’s brand—classy
                                    yet casual—was a recurring challenge, particularly with the menu. I achieved this by
                                    pairing modern typography with warm, earthy tones that conveyed both elegance and
                                    warmth, ensuring that the design remained approachable for all customers.
                                </p>
                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">Another critical aspect was ensuring that the
                                    designs translated seamlessly into their physical form. Collaborating with printing
                                    vendors, I verified color accuracy, textures, and print finishes to bring the
                                    designs to life as envisioned.
                                </p>
                                <h3 class="fw-bolder mt-5">Key Takeaways</h3>
                                <p class="fs-6 fw-normal lh-base mb-3">The project successfully generated excitement for
                                    Jama’s launch and reinforced its brand identity, with a hoarding board that
                                    captivated passersby and a menu design that balanced refinement and approachability.
                                    Seeing the designs printed and widely used was immensely rewarding, showcasing the
                                    power of cohesive branding. This experience highlighted the importance of
                                    consistency across touchpoints, collaboration with vendors for seamless execution,
                                    and the role of impactful design in shaping public perception and enhancing customer
                                    experiences.
